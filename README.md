# Titanic-Survival-project
The Titanic Survival Prediction Project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, resulting in the loss of over 1,500 lives.

The project involves exploring a dataset containing information about the passengers, including their socio-economic status, age, sex, cabin class, and other relevant factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on the available features.

The dataset typically includes the following variables:

Passenger ID: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Passenger's gender.
Age: Passenger's age.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
The project involves several key steps:

Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identifying missing values, and exploring relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Selection: Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or gradient boosting machines.

Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training the selected model(s) on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Tuning: Fine-tuning the model hyperparameters to improve performance and generalization.

Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the survival outcomes of passengers in a separate test dataset or new data.
